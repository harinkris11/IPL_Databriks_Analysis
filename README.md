# IPL Analysis with PySpark on Databricks

## Overview
This project demonstrates an analysis of IPL (Indian Premier League) cricket data using PySpark in a Databricks environment. The goal is to extract key insights and trends from IPL matches and player statistics. It leverages PySpark for distributed data processing and includes steps for data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation.

## Project Features
- **Data Source**: IPL matches and player statistics dataset loaded into Databricks.
- **Data Processing**: Utilizes PySpark for distributed processing of large IPL datasets.
- **Key Metrics**: Extracted cricket-related metrics like runs, wickets, overs, and player performance.
- **Insights**: Analysis of batting, bowling performances, and match outcomes across IPL seasons.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ipl-analysis-pyspark.git
    cd ipl-analysis-pyspark
    ```

2. Set up your Databricks environment:
    - Launch a Databricks cluster.
    - Install necessary dependencies:
      - `pyspark`
      - `databricks-connect`

3. Import the notebook into Databricks and attach it to your cluster.

4. Run the notebook step-by-step to process the IPL data and generate insights.

## How to Use
1. Load the dataset (IPL match and player stats) into a Databricks environment.
2. Follow the notebook to clean and preprocess the data using PySpark.
3. Execute the analysis to generate the desired insights and trends.

## Results
- **Batting Performance**: Analyze individual player performances and team batting statistics.
- **Bowling Performance**: Gain insights into bowling metrics such as wickets taken, economy rates, and bowling averages.
- **Match Outcomes**: Explore match results and trends over the IPL seasons.

## Future Work
- Expanding analysis to include additional metrics like fielding performance.
- Adding visualizations for more interactive data exploration.
- Integration with real-time IPL data for live analysis.
